This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. The game highlights the cells with different colors for each player and declares a winner or a draw when the game ends.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Player X starts the game by clicking on an empty cell.
3. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their mark (X or O).
4. The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
5. If a player wins, an alert will display the winner and the board will reset.
6. If the game ends in a draw, an alert will indicate the draw and the board will reset.
